#Food Donation Website
###Introduction
The Food Donation Website is a platform to connect food businesses with surplus food to non-profit organizations (NGOs) and other social initiatives working to alleviate hunger and food insecurity. This website is aimed to reduce food waste and help those in need by connecting food businesses with organizations that are looking for food donations.

Features
Food donation: Food businesses can easily donate their surplus food to NGOs and social initiatives registered on the platform.

Food pick-up: The platform enables NGOs and social initiatives to schedule pick-ups of donated food directly from food businesses.

Donate money: The platform allows individuals and organizations to make financial donations to support food recovery and distribution efforts.

Blogs: The website features educational blogs to create awareness about food waste and its impact on the environment and society.

Social events: The platform lists upcoming food recovery and distribution events, inviting users to participate and help make a difference.

Support for SDGs
This website aligns with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Deployment on Replit
Deploying this website on Replit helps to provide a more accessible and user-friendly platform for both food businesses and NGOs to engage with. Replit's platform provides an easy way to host the website, making it accessible to users from around the world.

How it fits into Open Innovation
This website follows the principles of open innovation by encouraging collaboration between food businesses and NGOs to address the problem of food waste and hunger. By fostering partnerships between these organizations, we are working towards finding solutions to these complex social and environmental problems.

Problem Statement
Food waste is a significant problem in many countries, including India. Every day, large quantities of food are wasted by food businesses due to overproduction, aesthetic standards, and other factors. This food could be used to feed those in need, but it often ends up in landfills instead. The Food Donation Website aims to address this issue by connecting food businesses with surplus food to NGOs and social initiatives working to alleviate hunger.

Conclusion
The Food Donation Website is a simple and effective solution to reduce food waste and help those in need. By connecting food businesses with NGOs, we are working towards a future where food waste is reduced, and no one goes hungry. Join us in our mission to make a difference.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
